# Prepare for a Wild Ride with Ravin' Rec!!!

### **A flashin' & buzzin' app to help you feel your audio wherever you go!**

Have you ever been (or seen) a concert where vendors readily supply audio-reactive LED gear? Have you ever waved your flashlight with a crowd to proverbially head bob as one? 
*Well Ravin' Rec is here to help you capture that feelin' the go!*

## Okay, so what does it do exactly?
Ravin' Rec focuses on capturing two components of sound to help maximize the feeling: *frequency/pitch* and *volume*, all through the power of your microphone!

In the very middle of the screen, there is a rectangle. As the app continuously listens to mic input, the rectangle will change its brightness, size, and color according to volume and frequency. The phone can also vibrate along with the volume. The louder the sound, the larger the rectangle, brighter the color, and stronger the vibration. The higher the sound, the warmer the color, and conversely, the lower the sound, the cooler the color.

## Will I only be able to look and stare at a jumpy rectangle?
**Nope!** Ravin' Rec features an array of customization options in the settings feature of the app. In here, you will have the ability to...

- Change the range of volume that the rectangle will react to
- Change the range of frequencies that the rectangle will react to
- Change whether you want the rectangle to change colors or just stay a single, chosen color
- Enable/disable the vibrations
- Enable/disable resizing of the rectangle

### And best of all... **it's better with friends!**
At the heart of this project is a rectangle with a desire to move to the beat, and what better way to groove is there than to groove with a swarm of others without having to move a muscle?
